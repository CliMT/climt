Installation

Stable release
--------------

.. NOTE::

    The GFS dynamical core has been made into a seperate package called 
    gfs_dynamical_core_ for ease of maintenance. If you need the dynamical core, 
    please install this package from source or directly using pip. Doing this will
    automatically install climt as well.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ install gfs_dynamical_core

You can install climt by simply typing

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install climt

This is the preferred method to install climt, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
On Ubuntu Linux, you might need to prefix the above command with :code:`sudo`. This command should
work on Linux, Mac and Windows. For Mac and Windows, it is recommended to use the `anaconda`_ python
distribution to make installation simpler.

.. NOTE::
    If you are not using Anaconda, please ensure you have the libpython library installed.
    See the next section for instructions to install libpython.

Since by default pip attempts to install a binary wheel, you won't need a compiler on your system.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

Installing from source
----------------------

The sources for climt can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/CliMT/climt

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/CliMT/climt/tarball/master


Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    $ python setup.py install

Both commands may require the use of :code:`sudo`.

Dependencies for source installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

climt depends on some easily installable libraries. For
an installation from source, it also requires that C and fortran
compilers be installed.

On Ubuntu Linux, for example, these dependencies can be
installed by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc
    $ sudo apt-get install gfortran
    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
    $ sudo pip install -U cython
    $ sudo pip install -U numpy

use :code:`pip3` and :code:`python3-dev` if you use Python 3.

On Mac OSX, it is recommended that you use `anaconda`_ as your python distribution.
This will eliminate the need to install cython, numpy and python-dev.
Once you have anaconda installed, you will need to do the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew install gcc
    $ export CC=gcc-x
    $ export FC=gfortran-x

Where :code:`gcc-x,gfortran-x` are the names of the C,Fortran compilers that Homebrew installs.
Exporting the name of the compiler is essential on Mac since the
default compiler that ships with Mac (called :code:`gcc`, but is actually a
different compiler) cannot
compile OpenMP programs, like the dynamical core in climt.
